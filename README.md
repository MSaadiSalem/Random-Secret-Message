    2. Rearrange the English letters images in alphabetical order.
    3. Generate a random message.
    4. Create a "secret-msg".
    5. Copy letters into "secret-msg" in character sequence of the random message.
    6. Rename the letter images in alphabet directory randomly.
    7. Check the OS platform, then open the file manager with the path that contains the message.
    8. Ask the user to keep the message or delete it.
